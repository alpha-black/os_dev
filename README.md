Notes:
1.  ELF - ELF is a format for storing programs or fragments of programs on disk, created as a result of compiling and linking. An ELF file is divided into sections.
    For an executable program, these are the text section for the code, the data section for global variables and the rodata section that usually contains constant strings.
